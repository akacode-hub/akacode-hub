option such as add to watch list and remove from the watch list . This also calculates the sum of bills that are there in the final list of purchase . It also allows you to add new 
movie items in the list based upon the customer choices and can also caluculate the overall renewed cost . Similar functionality is there for the removal of the movie in the final 
bill made for the customers .
